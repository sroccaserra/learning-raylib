Setup steps from zero to window:
- download raylib source ~ https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases
- unzip raylib source, go to src directory, `sudo make install`
- find C example in raylib's release README.md
- `gcc main.c -lraylib -lm`
- write a small Makefile and README.md to remember these complicated steps ;)

(From scratch sort of, some dev stuff like OpenGL dev libs where already
installed on my machine, I don't know.)
